# Drive Game

For my final project i wanted to create a game where you drive through obsticales at a high rate of speed

## Summary
 
The player of this game will be face with the challenge of driving through a narrow path to dodge obsticales. The game tests the player's hand I cordination with a map that changes everytime you win. The player is able to control the vehicle he or she is driving with arrow key input, while this might seem easy on paper its a totally different once your behind the drivers seat.
